The following key analyses are performed in the notebook:
1. Reading and cleaning the dataset.
2. Finding the undergraduate major with the highest starting median salary.
3. Identifying the major with the highest and lowest mid-career median salary.
4. Analyzing the spread between the 10th and 90th percentile salaries for each major.
5. Sorting the majors by the lowest risk (smallest spread) and highest 90th percentile salaries.
6. Grouping and summarizing the data by academic group.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary Python dependencies installed:
